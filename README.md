# Monte Carlo vs Black-Scholes Option Pricing: A Comparative Study with Real Market Data

## Project Summary

This project is acomparison between **Monte Carlo simulation** and the **Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM)** model for option pricing. We benchmark both models against **real market option prices** using data from Yahoo Finance via `yfinance`. The focus is on evaluating model performance across various tickers, strike prices, and expirations.

## ðŸ“ˆ Objectives

* Estimate call option prices using **Monte Carlo simulation**
* Calculate theoretical prices using the **Black-Scholes-Merton formula**
* Compare both model outputs against **real mid prices** of options from the market
* Provide **visualizations** for insights

##  Summary

### 1. Data Collection

* Downloaded **historical stock prices** for tickers from Yahoo Finance (AAPL, TSLA, JPM, XOM, JNJ, SPY, NVDA, CAT)
* Extracted **real call option chains** for each ticker for 5 expiration dates

### 2. Volatility Estimation

* Calculated **log returns** from historical prices
* Estimated **annualized volatility** per ticker using 1-year daily data

### 3. Black-Scholes Model

* Implemented BSM pricing for European call options
* Generated BSM price curves vs. expiry and strike prices

### 4. Monte Carlo Simulation

* Implemented MC pricing using Brownian motion
* Simulated terminal prices and estimated expected discounted payoff
* Generated MC price curves vs. expiry and strike prices

### 5. Real Market Comparison

* Extracted **mid prices** = (bid + ask)/2 for each real option
* Matched tickers, strike, and expiry for valid comparison
* Calculated **MC price per row** of the real dataset

### 6. Evaluation

* Compared **real vs MC vs BSM** for each option
* Plotted **price curves** with different styles to distinguish MC and BSM
* Plotted **diagnostic scatter plots** for error analysis

### 7. Observations & Insights

* BSM and MC models aligned well for near-the-money, liquid options
* Large deviations for deep ITM/OTM or illiquid options
* **Implied volatility** gave more realistic inputs than historical volatility

## ðŸ§® Monte Carlo Simulation Details & Visualizations

### Step-by-Step Monte Carlo Option Pricing:

1. **Annualized Volatility of Selected Tickers**

   * Calculated from historical daily log returns.
   * Annualized using the formula: $\sigma_{annual} = \sigma_{daily} \times \sqrt{252}$
   * ![Annualized Volatility](charts/annual_v.png)


2. **Simulating Terminal Stock Prices**

   * Formula:
     $S_T = S_0 \cdot \exp\left((r - 0.5 \cdot \sigma^2) \cdot T + \sigma \cdot \sqrt{T} \cdot Z\right)$
   * Where $Z \sim N(0, 1)$
   * Represents future stock price distribution after time T under risk-neutral assumptions
   * ![Simulation](charts/simulatedprice.png)

3. **Call Option Payoff Distribution**

   * Payoff for each strike: $\max(S_T - K, 0)$
   * Expected payoff discounted at risk-free rate gives the option price:
     $C = e^{-rT} \cdot \mathbb{E}[\max(S_T - K, 0)]$

4. **Put Option Payoff Distribution**

   * Payoff: $\max(K - S_T, 0)$
   * Similar logic for computing expected payoff and discounting

5. **Comparison Across Timeframes & Strikes**

   * Comparared MC with bsm prices for strike prices (e.g., 2.5%, 5%, 7.5% deviations from spot) across timeframes
   * Aggregated into dataframes per ticker
   * Used line plots to visualize how MC prices evolve with time to expiry
   * ![Simulation](charts/bsm_vs_mc.png)
     
6. **Error Metrics and Visulization**

   * CompareMC prices and real prices for strike prices (e.g., 2.5%, 5%, 7.5% deviations from spot) across timeframes

## ðŸ§® Methods

### Monte Carlo Formula:

```
S_T = S_0 * exp((r - 0.5 * sigma^2) * T + sigma * sqrt(T) * Z)
Price = exp(-r * T) * E[max(S_T - K, 0)]
```

### Black-Scholes Formula:

```
Call = S * N(d1) - K * exp(-rT) * N(d2)
d1 = [ln(S/K) + (r + 0.5 * sigma^2) * T] / (sigma * sqrt(T))
d2 = d1 - sigma * sqrt(T)
```
